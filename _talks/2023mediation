Semi-competing risks refer to the phenomenon that the terminal event (such as death) can truncate the non-terminal event 
(such as disease progression) but not vice versa. The treatment effect on the terminal event can be delivered either 
directly following the treatment or indirectly through the non-terminal event. We consider two strategies to decompose 
the total effect into a direct effect and an indirect effect under the framework of mediation analysis in completely 
randomized experiments, by adjusting the prevalence and hazard of non-terminal events, respectively. They require slightly 
different assumptions on cross-world quantities to achieve identifiability. We establish asymptotic properties for the 
estimated counterfactual cumulative incidences and decomposed treatment effects. Through simulation studies and real-data 
applications we illustrate the subtle difference between these two decompositions. We also discuss the interpretations of 
direct and indirect effects under the framework of separable effects.
