Postdoc research fellow, Biostatistics. <br />
Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

Background
======
I got my bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. 
However, I have a wide range of interests. I have a double bachelor's degree in economics from the National School of Development, Peking University, and completed a master's program (non-academic education) in human rights from the Law School, Peking University.
Now I am a postdoc research fellow at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan. <br />
Statisticians want to find patterns in complex social activities and discover knowledge from randomness in a rigorous way. As a methodological researcher, I wish to link statistical theories to practical applications, thereby contributing to scientific development.

Research interests
======
Causal inference (randomized controlled trials, observational studies, confounding, intercurrent events); <br />
Survival analysis (multi-state models, interval censoring); <br />
Semiparametric modeling (asymptotics, efficiency, double robustness); <br />
Econometrics (quasi-experiments, difference-in-differences).
