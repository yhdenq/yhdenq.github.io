Postdoc research fellow, Biostatistics. <br />
Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

Background
======
I earned my bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University. 
However, I have a wide range of interests. I have a double bachelor's degree in economics from the National School of Development, Peking University, and completed a master's program (non-academic education) in human rights from the Law School, Peking University.
I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. <br />
Statisticians seek to identify patterns in complex social activities and derive knowledge from randomness in a rigorous way. As a methodological researcher, I aim to connect statistical theories to practical applications, thereby advancing scientific development.

Research interests
======
Causal inference (randomized controlled trials, observational studies, mediation, intercurrent events); <br />
Survival analysis (multi-state models, interval censoring); <br />
Semiparametric modeling (asymptotics, efficiency, double robustness); <br />
Econometrics (quasi-experiments, difference-in-differences).

Latest
======
* I will chair a session, "Learning from Science for Synthesized Knowledge: Integrative Analysis and Meta-Analysis," at the [Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2026/) in Boston (August 1-6, 2026).
